      "Shelly was quick to understand our brand and what kind of audience to reach on Instagram. She does a great job with social media engagement, allowing me to focus on the other aspects of the business. With Shelly's help, we have been able to grow our Instagram following up to 10x in under 2 months. She is knowledgeable and easy to work with, would definitely recommend working with her!",
