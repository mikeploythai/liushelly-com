#### 🚨 About forking (PLEASE READ)

The main intent behind leaving the source code public is for the curious to look at. It's not intended to be used by developers as a template for their own website, but if you really, *really* wanted to use it as such, **you must provide credit in both your README and in your website's footer by linking back to this repository**.

Please understand that the forking policy could change at anytime and without notice (but realistically, it probably won't), and that no guides or resources will be given to you directly to help you modify the code to your liking.

Other than that, good luck and have fun! 🫡
