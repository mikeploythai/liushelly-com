The official website of Shelly Liu and her digital marketing agency, Socials by Shelly.

This repository showcases **version 2.1** of the website, which was rebuilt from the ground up to provide a better user experience to her clients when visiting the website, and to Shelly when she makes content in her Sanity Studio. Feel free to visit the [branches][branches] page to look at any prior versions of the source code.
